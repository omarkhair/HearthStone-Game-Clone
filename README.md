# Project Description
This is a clone of the famous 2D Card Game **Hearthstone**. The game is implemented from scratch with Java using Object Oriented Programming principals. The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design architecture is used. The graphical user interface was built using Java Swing library and the whole theme was designed by our team.

Here are two videos of the gameplay of our Hearthstone clone: 
1. [LAN gameplay](https://youtu.be/iuIbOfyIUh0)
2. [Single device gameplay](https://youtu.be/Qe5ddbLfhU0)

## Bonus Features :)
We implemented 2 bonus features that were not required in the project description.
1. An **Extra-Ordinary** GUI of the game was developed with a completely new **Icy** theme and play sounds. It gives you an immersive experience that is as wonderful as the actual Hearthstone. 
2. A **LAN** gameplay option where you can play against and challenge your friends that are connected to your local area network.

## How to start the game?
1. [Download](https://github.com/omarkhair/HearthStone-Game-Clone/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the game, or clone the project using git. It's around 200 MB. 
2. There are 2 ways you can start our Hearthstone :
   1.  Just click on the HearthStone.exe file. You have to have java runtime environment(JRE 1.6.0) installed on your machine.
   2. Open the project in your favourite IDE, go to src/view/Start.java and run it.
3. In the starting window , you have 2 options **START** and **LAN Mode**.
    * START means both players will play on the same device.
    * LAN Mode means each player will play on different device but should both be on the same Local Area Network.
4. For START , you will choose the two heroes from the same device. Choose both heroes by clicking on their icons then press Play. 
5.  For LAN Mode ,you will choose hero from the left panel, then you may invite a friend with his IP Address or you can wait for a friend's invitation. Once you or your friend accept the invitation, you can start the game.

Congrats! You successfully created a game.

## Tips on how to play the game
Here are some tips to get used to the interface:
* The message bar in the middle will be your guide through the game.
* Each player will take either the upper or the lower half.
* To play a card or a spell, click on its photo and click play from the left panel.
* To target a hero click on its photo on the right. Please try to click on the upper part of the hero icon  as you may accidentally click on the hero power instead.
* To use the hero power click on the circular icon beside the hero photo.
